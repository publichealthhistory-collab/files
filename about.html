  <h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Public Health History</em> is a non-commercial public history project that explores how
    societies around the world have understood, addressed and contested health, disease and
    wellbeing over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project uses historical case studies, sites and ideas to examine public health not as
    a simple story of linear progress, but as a field shaped by power, inequality, culture and
    contested values. It aims to use historical perspective to inform contemporary public health
    thinking and practice.
  </p>

    particular attention to the social determinants of health, equity, participation and the
    role of historical context in shaping public health policy and practice.
