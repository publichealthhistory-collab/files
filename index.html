    <p>
      Public Health History is a YouTube channel dedicated to exploring how societies around the
      world have understood, addressed and contested health, disease and wellbeing over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project brings public health approaches and principles into conversation with history,
      examining public health challenges in their social, political, economic and environmental
      contexts. Rather than presenting public health as a simple story of linear progress, the
      series emphasises contingency, local knowledge, community agency and the uneven consequences
      of public health interventions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public Health History takes a global and inclusive perspective. It recognises that many
      issues now framed as “public health problems” were understood very differently in the past,
      and that historical responses were shaped by power, culture, resources and prevailing ideas
      about citizenship, responsibility and risk. The series also foregrounds the role of social
      determinants of health, environmental change and climate in shaping long-term health outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A core aim of the project is to critically examine both the achievements and the harms of
      public health. This includes acknowledging public health’s historical involvement in
      colonisation, racism, gender and social exclusion and environmental damage, alongside its
      contributions to improved health and wellbeing. By situating these histories within their
      specific contexts, the project seeks to learn from past successes and failures in ways that
      support equity, participation and human rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website provides background notes, historical context, sources and recommended readings
      for selected episodes. References are prioritised, with open-access materials highlighted
      wherever possible. The broader goal is to use historical insight to inform contemporary
      public health thinking and practice, particularly in a period of global uncertainty and
      complex health challenges.
