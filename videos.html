      <h3>Episode 1: Health by the People</h3>

     <p>
    In 1751, the English artist William Hogarth published two engravings—<em>Gin Lane</em> and
    <em>Beer Street</em>—that have since become iconic images of the social and health anxieties
    surrounding alcohol consumption in eighteenth-century London.
  </p>

  <p>
    Produced during the height of the so-called “gin craze,” the paired images present a stark
    contrast. <em>Gin Lane</em> depicts a community in collapse, marked by poverty, neglect,
    hunger and social disorder, while <em>Beer Street</em> presents a prosperous and orderly
    urban world supported by productive labour, good health and social stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    This episode examines the engravings as an early form of public health communication.
    Rather than reading them simply as moral warnings about individual behaviour, the video
    situates Hogarth’s work within wider debates about poverty, labour, urbanisation and social
    order, and explores the political and economic conditions that fuelled the gin craze.
  </p>

  <p>
    The episode asks a broader public health question that remains relevant today: how health
    problems are framed, who is blamed, and how moral narratives can obscure the structural
    conditions that produce ill-health in the first place.

  <h3>Episode 2: The Sulabh International Museum of Toilets — Sanitation, History and Social Change</h3>

  <p>
    This episode visits the Sulabh International Museum of Toilets in Delhi, a unique institution
    that uses history, humour and design to explore the global development of sanitation over the
    past four and a half thousand years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The museum presents toilets not simply as technical artefacts, but as deeply social objects
    shaped by culture, religion, inequality and power. Its collection ranges from early sanitation
    systems of the Indus Valley civilisation to medieval commodes, nineteenth-century furniture
    toilets and contemporary innovations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The episode also explores the work of the Sulabh organisation, founded in 1970 by sociologist
    Bindeshwar Pathak, whose twin-pit pour-flush compost toilet system has played a major role in
    reducing open defecation and eliminating manual scavenging in India.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than treating toilets as a marginal or taboo topic, the episode shows how sanitation
    sits at the heart of public health, social justice and environmental protection, and why
    historical perspective remains essential for addressing contemporary sanitation challenges.
